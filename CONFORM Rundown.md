CON/FORM LAGOS
A Cultural System for Conversation, Creation & Continuity
Dates: March 20–21, 2026
Location: University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria
Lead Convener: Shola Bamidele
1. INTRODUCTION
CON/FORM is a two-day cultural platform designed to bring creatives, artisans,
entrepreneurs, institutions, and brands into one shared space to confront how culture is
created, funded, governed, and sustained in Nigeria and Africa.
It is not positioned as a traditional conference or festival.
CON/FORM is a system-building experience — beginning with honest conversation and
culminating in live expression and performance.
2. THE PROBLEM
Africa’s creative economy is expanding rapidly, yet:
● Creators remain under-supported and under-protected
● Institutions struggle to engage culture authentically
● Brands seek relevance but lack proximity and trust
● Systems that support creativity are fragmented or absent
There is visibility without structure, noise without longevity, and talent without
sustainability.
3. THE PURPOSE (WHY CON/FORM EXISTS)
CON/FORM exists to:
● Create honest, cross-sector conversations about creativity, economy, identity,
power, and systems
● Bridge the gap between culture and infrastructure
● Allow creatives, brands, and institutions to design solutions together
● Build a shared understanding of how culture can scale without losing integrity
At its core, CON/FORM asks:
How do we align our creative expression with sustainable systems, shared values,
and collective goals?
4. PHILOSOPHY & FRAMEWORK
ARCHITECTS & EXECUTORS
CON/FORM introduces a framework that removes hierarchy while honoring experience:
● Architects
Individuals who designed or shaped cultural, creative, and economic systems —
pioneers, industry leaders, institutional figures.
● Executors
Individuals currently operating within those systems — emerging creatives,
artisans, founders, entrepreneurs, and youth.
Both groups are equally essential.
CON/FORM places them in conversation, not competition.
5. EVENT STRUCTURE
DAY 1 — ENTERING THE SYSTEM
Focus: Thought, honesty, structure, conversation
Time: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM
Day 1 is designed as a guided journey into how culture is built, lived, and sustained.
Every segment intentionally leads into the next.
11:00 – 11:20 AM
ARRIVAL & IMMERSION: ENTERING THE SYSTEM
Experience Design:
● LED walls displaying looping visual prompts:
○ “You did not create the system you entered.”
○ “Culture does not disappear. It either decays or evolves.”
● Ambient sound design (industrial / minimal)
● Sponsors already present as environments, not ads (Samsung screens, MTN
signal zone, Classic Car Vault visual presence)
Purpose:
Attendees are not “entering an event.”
They are entering a system.
11:20 – 11:35 AM
OPENING ADDRESS: WHY CON/FORM EXISTS
Speaker: Shola Bamidele (Lead Convener)
Purpose:
● Formally welcome attendees
● Clearly state why CON/FORM exists
● Introduce the Architects & Executors framework
● Name the tension:
○ Talent vs structure
○ Culture vs economy
○ Expression vs sustainability
Key Framing Statement:
“CON/FORM is not asking creatives to shrink.
It is asking systems to finally match their scale.”
11:35 – 11:50 AM
SHORT FILM 01 (GUIDING NARRATIVE)
Working Title: The Code We Inherited
(Title for internal use; public-facing title can differ)
Film Focus:
● How culture, aspiration, and identity are inherited
● How systems were formed without today’s creators in mind
● How people survive inside structures they didn’t design
Purpose:
This film becomes the narrative spine of Day 1.
Everything that follows is a response to it.
12:00 – 1:15 PM
PANEL SESSION 1 — THE ARCHITECTS
Theme: Designing Culture That Lasts
Who This Is For:
Senior cultural figures, institutional leaders, legacy builders.
Who This Panel Represents:
The people who shaped the systems — intentionally or unintentionally — that
creatives now operate within.
Focus Areas:
● How cultural systems were built
● What compromises were made
● What consequences were not anticipated
● What responsibility legacy builders still hold
Key Question:
“When culture became industry, what did we protect — and what did we lose?”
Format Note:
This is not celebratory.
It is honest, reflective, and accountable.
1:15 – 1:30 PM
SPOKEN WORD / POETRY RESPONSE
Purpose:
● Emotional grounding
● Translating institutional language into human language
● Giving voice to what cannot be said in panels
Instruction to Artist:
Respond directly to something said in The Architects panel.
1:30 – 2:00 PM
THE SYSTEMS INTERLUDE (NEW — CRITICAL ADDITION)
Theme:
From Culture to Infrastructure
This is not a panel.
This is a live systems walkthrough.
Who Appears Here (Examples):
● Classic Car Vault → Heritage as a business system
● Providus Bank → Financial structure for creatives
● Samsung / MTN → Tools, connectivity, and scale
● Rotary / Eonsfleet → Logistics, ethics, modern artisanship
Format:
● Moderated walkthrough
● Each participant answers one structured prompt:
1. What system do you operate?
2. Why does it last?
3. What can creatives learn from it?
Purpose:
● Show that culture only survives when structure exists
● Demonstrate that brands and institutions are operators, not spectators
● Bridge Panels 1 and 2 logically
Why This Matters:
This is where CON/FORM becomes different from every other creative event.
2:00 – 3:00 PM
NETWORKING & ACTIVATION WINDOW
What Happens Here:
● Sponsor activations fully live
● Classic Car Vault vehicles experienced as cultural artifacts
● Informal conversations sparked by Systems Interlude
● Creatives engage brands with context, not desperation
Purpose:
Let ideas breathe.
Let relationships form naturally.
3:00 – 4:15 PM
PANEL SESSION 2 — THE EXECUTORS
Theme: Living Inside the System
Who This Is For:
Emerging creatives, artisans, founders, entrepreneurs.
Who This Panel Represents:
The people executing life inside systems they did not design.
Focus Areas:
● Daily creative survival
● Economic pressure vs creative integrity
● Mental, emotional, and financial toll
● What support structures are missing
Key Question:
“If this is the system you built, this is how it feels to live inside it.”
Important Note:
This panel is not complaint-based.
It is evidence-based.
4:15 – 4:30 PM
SHORT FILM 02 / PERFORMANCE RESPONSE
Working Theme: Rewriting the Code
Purpose:
● Transition from diagnosis to possibility
● Emotional release
● Prepare the room for Day 2
4:30 – 5:30 PM
BRAND & INSTITUTION CONVERSATIONS (OPEN FORMAT)
Format:
● Fireside chats
● Small group conversations
● Q&A circles
Focus:
● How creatives can realistically engage brands
● How brands actually make decisions
● Where collaboration is possible (and where it isn’t)
Purpose:
Remove mystique.
Replace assumptions with understanding.
5:30 – 6:00 PM
DAY 1 CLOSING: HOLDING THE TENSION
Speaker: Shola Bamidele (or designated facilitator)
Purpose:
● Summarise what was heard
● Acknowledge unresolved tension
● Frame Day 2 as release, expression, and embodiment
Closing Statement (Tone):
“We have named the system.
Tomorrow, we will express what it feels like to live inside it.”
DAY 2 — EXPRESSION & RELEASE (UNCHANGED, BUT CLARIFIED)
Day 2 is earned.
It is not a random performance.
It is the emotional and cultural release of Day 1’s conversations.
● Live performances
● DJ sets
● Visual art & installations
● Community celebration
Day 2 answers one thing:
“If we understand the system better, how do we express ourselves differently?”
11. CONCLUSION
CON/FORM is where:
● Creators speak honestly
● Brands listen actively
● Institutions engage meaningfully
● Culture moves from noise to structure
It is a space to confront, rethink, and re-form how culture works.
