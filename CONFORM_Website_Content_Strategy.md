The Story Behind CON/FORM
```

### OPENING COPY
```
In 2020, a creative hub called Loom Rooms was born in Egbeda, Alimosho. Not in Victoria Island. Not in Lekki. In Egbeda—where most people said creativity couldn't thrive.

They were wrong.

Loom Rooms has since nurtured 200+ creatives across film, music, fashion, and visual arts. We've proven that talent isn't bound by geography—it's fueled by community, culture, and opportunity.
```

### THE VISION SECTION

**SUBHEADING:**
```
Why CON/FORM?
```

**BODY:**
```
CON/FORM is the next evolution. It's not just a showcase—it's a movement.

**Day 1 (CON):** We deconstruct the barriers, biases, and old ways of thinking that limit creativity.

**Day 2 (FORM):** We rebuild. 70+ artists show you what's possible when creativity is unleashed.

This is more than an event. It's proof that Alimosho—and every overlooked community—can be a launchpad for greatness.
```
