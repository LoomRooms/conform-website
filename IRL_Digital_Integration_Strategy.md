# CON/FORM IRL + Digital Integration Strategy

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the CON/FORM website from a promotional tool into a **central interactive hub** during the two-day event. The goal is to drive massive traffic by making the website necessary for the physical experience.

## 🚀 Key Integration Concepts

### 1. The "Artifact Hunt" (QR Scavenger Hunt)
*   **The Idea**: Hide 10-15 unique QR codes across the venue (inside art installations, under bars, on speaker stands).
*   **The Interaction**: Scanning a code "collects" a digital artifact on the website.
*   **The Reward**: Collecting all artifacts unlocks a "Hidden Collection" gallery or a voucher for event merch.
*   **Traffic Driver**: Users will keep the site open as they "collect" items throughout the day.

### 2. "Digital Concierge" (Smart Seating)
*   **The Idea**: Every seat/section has a small, discrete QR code.
*   **The Interaction**: Scanning verifies the seat number and provides a "Digital Program" specific to that view.
*   **The Reward**: Instant access to the artist bios of the performers currently on stage or upcoming for that specific section.

### 3. "The Collective Pulse" (Live Voting)
*   **The Idea**: During live battles or showcases, the MC prompts the audience to "vibe check" the artist on the website.
*   **The Interaction**: A real-time poll on the home page.
*   **The Visual**: The website displays a live "heat map" of the audience's response, which is mirrored on the venue's massive LED screens.

### 4. AR "Art Mirrors"
*   **The Idea**: QR codes next to physical paintings/fashion pieces.
*   **The Interaction**: Scanned codes open a special "Mirror" view on the phone (using the website) that adds AR labels, animations, or the artist's spoken-word explanation of the piece.

### 5. "Live Social Wall"
*   **The Idea**: A dedicated section on the homepage: "CON/FORM: Right Now".
*   **The Interaction**: Pulls in public Instagram/X posts using the hashtag `#CONFORMREVEAL`.
*   **The Visual**: A breathtaking, fast-moving cinematic marquee of visitor photos. Seeing yourself on the homepage is a massive incentive to share.

### 6. Geofenced "Unlockables"
*   **The Idea**: Certain high-end gallery pages on the site are "locked".
*   **The Interaction**: They only unlock if the user's browser location is within the venue or if they scan a "Master Key" QR code at the entrance.

## 🛠 Project Research & Next Steps

### Phase 1: Prototype "The Artifact Hunt"
*   **Tech**: Supabase for real-time tracking of "collected" items per user account.
*   **UI**: A "Backpack" or "Vault" tab on the Artists/Experience pages.

### Phase 2: Live Feedback Loop
*   **Tech**: Pusher or Supabase Realtime for instant poll updates.

### Phase 3: Wayfinding
*   **Tech**: Mapbox integration for a mini-map of the venue on the site.

> [!TIP]
> **Why this works**: It turns "scrolling" into "exploring". Every physical action has a digital reaction, making the website the "brain" of the event.
